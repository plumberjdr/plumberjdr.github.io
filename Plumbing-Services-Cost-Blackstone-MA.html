In some cases throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. Some of those thin areas leak right away and sometimes those leaks come days or weeks later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be properly re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
