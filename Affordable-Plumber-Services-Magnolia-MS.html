<p>Hidden sets of pipes utilize pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a separate drain pathway, small pipes range from the tub and sink to eventually meet a bigger one below the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the home. A great method to decrease the amount of food waste in your kitchen is to install a garbage disposal. Quickly and effectively eliminating remaining potato peels, fruit skins and numerous other types of food waste, the disposal grinds all of it into fine particles that are flushed out of the chamber and into your home drainage, waste and vent system or what you most likely call your sewer.</p>

It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
