<p>Lubrication might assist with the placement of some elements within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not assist the assembly work any much better, it is just there to help the specialist put together the elements into the body without creating damage from friction. The lubricant needs to be a food grade lube to ensure the water supply is not contaminated. In most cases the best lube is water. The normal usage for lubricant in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings should be gently lubed to assure they do not roll out of their retainer. The use of excessive lube can cause the backflow prevention assembly to wear or fail out earlier by drawing in dirt and particles or limiting the motion of the part. The proper amount of lube should make the surface of the 'ring appear wet. You should never see chunks or globs of lubricant.</p>
