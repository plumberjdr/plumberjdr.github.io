The system must grind the waste even finer to avoid blockages and enable the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields. As soon as, the gas pipe shows up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, but must then transition to galvanized. I am not sure why that must be. It is likewise permitted to use black iron if it is most likely coated with a galvanized covering (which is basically an unique paint"). When plumbing in their gas meters, PG&E typically does this.</p>
