<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions.

A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the brand-new heater. To guarantee that we are providing premium work and customer assurance, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and completely trained to securely carry out hot water heater replacements.
