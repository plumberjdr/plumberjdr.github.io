<p>Your initial step is to turn off the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A versatile supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a different style from the one we show, inspect the instructions. After installing the valve (Picture 6), link the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>

Performance and resilience are essential components of every water heater we sell. That's why locals of Centreville, Fairfax, Herndon, Reston, Leesburg, and other parts of Northern Virginia have actually been using Service Specialties for water heater installations for almost 40 years now. Our local plumbing contractors are happy to work with you to come up with the best water heater system for your house or company.</p>
<p>Cooking oil and other greases need to never be put down the waste disposal unit because they can hamper the blades. Lastly, cold water should be running when the garbage disposal is on and need to continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is shut off to guarantee that all food particles have actually been rinsed through the pipes. Baffles: Baffles avoid silverware from getting in the garbage disposal, so you're just sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
