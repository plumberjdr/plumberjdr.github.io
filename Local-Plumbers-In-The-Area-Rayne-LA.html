<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, but if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>

Call (866) 701-5306 to schedule a consultation. A climatic vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not commonly defined by water purveyors.  It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic operational use, water pressure presses the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, permitting the device to drain as well as preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely essential here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.  Think of this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It likewise has to lie a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>

The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new unit.</p>
<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
