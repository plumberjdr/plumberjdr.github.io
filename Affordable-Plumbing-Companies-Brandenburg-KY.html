<p>This is an elbow-shaped device bent at a 90 degree angle. There is a valve on the inside of it that prevents water backflow.

<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, lowered iron will be removed by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are offered if the resin has currently been fouled. Once again, it is advisable to check the maker's instructions for unique precautions.</p>
<p>Hard water, debris from old pipes or particles from a break in a city water line can avoid a flush valve from closing totally. Running water through it from the supply line will clear the debris. Photos 1 and 2 reveal you how to do this on one common type of valve. Despite the fact that other valves will look different, the clearing process is similar. Nevertheless, you may have to remove a couple of screws on top of the fill valve to remove the cap.</p>
