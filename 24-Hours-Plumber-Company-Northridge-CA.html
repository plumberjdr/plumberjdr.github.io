Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem.

The test period shall not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system will stand up to the test pressure specified without showing any evidence of leak or other problems. Mechanical evaluates utilized to measure test pressures will have a range such that the highest end of the scale is not greater than 5 times the test pressure. For example, a 3 psi test will require a maximum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test might be carried out using a 50 pound gauge, but not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge noticeable at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not show the minimum pressure required for the test, or any reduction of test pressures as indicated by pressure determines during inspection shall be considered to suggest the existence of a leak.</p>
