<p>There are different products utilized in re-piping, in water supply re-piping some of the products are metal and possibly some plastic pipes. The metal pipes are galvanized steel or iron, copper, and brass. The plastic pipes are Poly Vinyl Chloride PVC, Chlorine Poly Vinyl Chloride CPVC, Poly Ethylene PE, Polybutylene PB, and Kitec.

<p>Drip Leg - Any dust or grit in the gas line falls under this brief area of pipe prior to it can reach the hot water heater's control valve. The needed length of the drip leg varies. Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and need fewer repairs with time.

The California Contractors State Licensing Board (CSLB) requires licensed plumbers to restore their license every two years.</p>
<p>A water softener has a resin tank including thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regrowed, the beads end up being full of sodium ions from the water softener salt. As hard water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. When water is heated up, tough water triggers gray or white deposits. Water softening can be used to lower these signs.</p>
