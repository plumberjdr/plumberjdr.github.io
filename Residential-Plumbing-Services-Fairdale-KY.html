<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
