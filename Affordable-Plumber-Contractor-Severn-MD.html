<p>Backflow prevention gadgets are designed to safeguard the public water supply from cross-connections. A contemporary neighborhood supply of water system is created to ensure that water flows to properties and structures under pressure. This community water network consists of numerous users where there is a danger to public health if there is a cross-connection in between the supply of water and an infected source. A cross-connection can happen where there is a pressure drop in the water main. This pressure drop causes a vacuum and siphons of entrainment water from end-users into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>When you turn your watering system on, it's a great idea to evaluate your backflow assembly every spring. However, we hardly ever suggest CPVC when an entire house needs repiping.

<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two dead giveaways of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect with time, they gradually start to constrict the circulation of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a long time for this much buildup to take place, so by the time you observe it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your supply of water, affecting your water quality.</p>
