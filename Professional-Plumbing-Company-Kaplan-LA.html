Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

This may hold true in many cases, but most of the time you will save yourself difficulty, time and money if you call an experienced plumber when you do not understand anything about toilet repair.</p>
