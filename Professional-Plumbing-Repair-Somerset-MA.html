It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard operational usage, water pressure presses the seat up and closes off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain as well as avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is really important here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure against back pressure.  Think of this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It likewise has to lie at least 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
