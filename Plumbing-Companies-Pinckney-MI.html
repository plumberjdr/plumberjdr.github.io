<p>Camera are one of the most important tools in the plumbing organisation. A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>

<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Since I love to prepare, I produce a whole lot of meals. We set up a momentary workaround at our guest bathroom sink, but after a day of this we recognized that we needed the sink fixed ASAP.  Fritz remained in and out of the home within thirty minutes and he ensures that the sink will stay clog-free for 30 days. If it obstructs again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!  We are very delighted that we chose Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will absolutely utilize this company again and again in the future.</p>
