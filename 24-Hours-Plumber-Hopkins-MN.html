<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. The majority of home centers carry just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet.
