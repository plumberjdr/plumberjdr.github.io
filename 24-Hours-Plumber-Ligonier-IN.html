<p>House owners can ask for a plumbing inspection at any time, however it is specifically prudent to arrange inspections on an annual basis and when buying a new house. Call us For Professional Drain Cleaning if Your Drains Are Sluggish. Plumbers are now able to use video technology to see inside sewer and water lines. A tiny camera affixed to a cable television is placed into a line or a pipe and sends video footage to the plumber. This tool can be important in detecting problems and helping a plumber plan repairs. The next level up, in terms of cost and defense supplied, is called a pressure vacuum breaker, or PVB. This device prevents back siphonage only. A pressure vacuum breaker has a spring-loaded check valve that will close whenever water stops streaming with an air relief valve that opens to break the siphon when pressure drops to 1 PSI.</p>
