Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl).

If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
