<p>Backflow is bad news. Secure the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the diminished salt water solution after the regeneration cycle. Clamp the drain hose firmly and feed it into the dedicated drain, like a floor drain or utility sink. To avoid the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain hoses must have an air gap. Completion of the hose be at least 2 inches above the devoted drain. An air gap may be used to achieve this, and may be needed depending on local plumbing codes.</p>
