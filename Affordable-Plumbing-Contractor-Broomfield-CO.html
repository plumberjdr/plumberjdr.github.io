<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and cleanly stored for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
