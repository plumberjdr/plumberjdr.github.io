<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Because water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and cleanly stored for later use when demand rate surpasses supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
