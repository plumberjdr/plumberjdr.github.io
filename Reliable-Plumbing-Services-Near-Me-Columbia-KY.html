<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is just capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (typically sodium or often potassium).</p>

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers carry just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close.
