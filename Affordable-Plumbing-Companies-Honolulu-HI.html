In some cases throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes. Some of those thin areas leak right now and often those leaks come days or weeks later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be properly re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
