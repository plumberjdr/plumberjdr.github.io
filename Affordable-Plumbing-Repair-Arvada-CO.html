It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic operational usage, water pressure pushes the seat up and closes off the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain as well as avoiding back siphonage.
