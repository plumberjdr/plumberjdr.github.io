<p>If you start to notice lower water pressure in your sink or shower, this might be a sign of rust and mineral build-up which will slowly start to obstruct the circulation of water through your pipes. For build-up to impact your water pressure like this, it means that it has actually been accumulating for years so you must look into getting a plumbing inspection right away to guarantee your pipes haven't caused any considerable damage, and plan on changing your piping at some point quickly.</p>

<p>Without a water softener, laundry needs additional detergent to avoid it from looking dingy. Dishes will come out of your dishwasher stained and streaked. Cloudy residue develops on your shower drapes and your soap and shampoo will not lather. Bathing in difficult water leaves your skin itchy and dry and your hair lifeless and sticky. The large amount of energy, cash, and time required to clean up the harmful adverse effects of difficult water is dizzying. A whole home water softener is the solution to the scourge of water firmness.</p>
