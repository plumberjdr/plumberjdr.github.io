<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains.

You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
