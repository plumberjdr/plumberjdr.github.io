The pipes can become fragile, with time, and may need replacement earlier than hoped. Some states need pipefitters and steamfitters to be licensed; they might also require an unique license to deal with gas lines. Licensing usually needs a test or work experience or both. Contact your state's licensing board to learn more.</p>
<p>When repiping it is essential to understand that there are various kinds of pipes, each with various advantages and life-spans. When selecting a contractor to repipe your home, make sure to ask what pipes they provide and advise for your task.
