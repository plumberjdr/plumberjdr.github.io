<p>To help avoid blockages within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of use the approach laid out above. Due to the fact that the baffle efficiently cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste should travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is especially true. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
