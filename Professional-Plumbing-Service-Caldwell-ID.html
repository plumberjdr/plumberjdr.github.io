The pro will next check your hot water heater. With your water heater, she or he is looking at water temperature, pressure relief valves and pipes, and any rust in the tank (unless it's a tankless hot water heater ).

<p>A brand-new hot water heater will likely last longer, give you less problems, and cost you less to run in time. Sluggish drains: If you observe that your drains are clearing slower, it could be a sign of the early phases of a clog.
