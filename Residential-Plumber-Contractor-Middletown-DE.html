<p>When purchasing a brand-new home, it is essential to guarantee the dependability of your drain and sewer lines. A lot of plumbing is concealed behind walls and underground. ZOOM DRAIN Â® can perform a comprehensive video inspection of your drainage system utilizing cutting-edge video camera inspection equipment specially designed to identify any irregularities within your brand-new property's main drain line.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
