<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Longmont CO</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon for how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a problem-- for its many desired usages around your house.</p>
