With a water heater replacement, you'll fix your repair issues, and have enhanced water heater performance too. The sodium uptake through softened water depends on the solidity of the water. Averagely, less than 3% sodium uptake comes from consuming softened water. Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening.
