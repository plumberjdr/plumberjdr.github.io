<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one instructions, but avoids it from going backwards in the opposite instructions. But is a plumbing disaster impending or just an issue for the long run? Changing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom home expenses $4,000 to $10,000, and requires cutting open walls and floors, so you definitely do not want to do the job before it's essential.

They are not intended to have constant pressure on the downstream side and can not be used as a master valve.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most typical. To eliminate the disposer, support it from below and rotate the big, 3-tab installing ring on top counterclockwise till the unit falls away. Get rid of the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
