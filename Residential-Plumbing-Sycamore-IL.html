<p>Leaks are tricky. While the time needed will differ based on your home size and the number of discovered breakdowns, it's best to set aside up to 2 hours when you set up an inspection. There's constantly the chance that your plumber's previous task will run long and postpone the beginning time. If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely rushed the job (unless you have an extremely little plumbing system). When you contact us to arrange your visit, ask how long the inspection typically takes.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it needs to put something back into the water.

This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the salt in the brine tank replenished.</p>
