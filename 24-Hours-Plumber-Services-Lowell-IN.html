<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften hard water.

Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.

The test period will not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system will endure the test pressure specified without showing any evidence of leakage or other defects. Mechanical gauges used to measure test pressures will have a range such that the highest end of the scale is not higher than 5 times the test pressure.

The piping system shall be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge visible at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not show the minimum pressure required for the test, or any reduction of test pressures as indicated by pressure assesses during inspection will be deemed to indicate the existence of a leak.</p>
