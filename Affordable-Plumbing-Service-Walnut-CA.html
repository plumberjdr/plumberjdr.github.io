<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style).

This process continues till all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the hardness ions) and the bed is considered totally regrowed.</p>
