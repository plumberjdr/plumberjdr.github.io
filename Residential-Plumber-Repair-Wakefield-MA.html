The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.</p>
<p>We utilize specialized diagnostic strategies and modern tools to ensure that your bathroom and kitchen sinks, tubs and showers, toilets, floor drains, and main sewer lines are all in top condition. Often times you might hear that your toilet has actually continued to run after it's been flushed. This can cause the water to spill down the into the overflow tube. This concern might occur by a pipe with blockage or a malfunction with your flush valve. This can likewise be remedied by changing your flapper valve.</p>

PVC assemblies are an excellent choice s they can be easily connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and ensure it sets before testing the drain.</p>
