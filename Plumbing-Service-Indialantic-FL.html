I really received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
