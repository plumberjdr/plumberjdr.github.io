<p>Watering backflow devices are created for installation on safe and clean water lines to protect versus both back-siphonage and back-pressure of polluted water into the drinkable water system. While there's not a specific schedule regarding when you need to repipe your home, you must definitely look into repiping if they haven't been carried out in 50 years or more-- specifically if you reside in an older house developed closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our a/c unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech explain exactly what was incorrect with the unit, how he repaired the problem, and how to prevent a reaccuance. I would extremely advise Hunter for any concerns you might have.</p>

The water suppliers typically do not have the capability to repeatedly examine every consumer's properties for cross-connections and backflow defense. Typically, this would consist of the water service connection to each committed fire protection system or watering piping system and the water service connection to each of the following types of premises: (1) facilities with an auxiliary or recovered water system; (2) industrial, medical, laboratory, other or marine centers where objectionable substances are managed in a way that could trigger contamination or contamination of the general public water supply; (3) properties exempt from the State Plumbing Code inspection and properties where an internal backflow prevention assembly required under the State Plumbing Code is not effectively installed or kept; (4) classified or restricted facilities; and (5) high buildings.</p>
