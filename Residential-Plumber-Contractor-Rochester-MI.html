<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Rochester MI</h3>

Clogged drains can quickly become major concerns if not dealt with properly. Call us today at (303) 758-6237 for fast, precise service in Denver and the surrounding locations. We've already seen what these 2 terms share, so what's the distinction between them? When it concerns the problem of hard water, a standard water softener actually gets rid of calcium, silica and magnesium ions, leaving it with little quantities of what is known as short-lived solidity". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, however if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
