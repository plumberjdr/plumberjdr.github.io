<p>I wished to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the best 1st experience with the beginning of our home enhancements. George and Anthony did a fantastic job for us.

<p>Our recommendation: Normally you'll want to choose PEX pipes not only because they are affordable, however due to the fact that they're reliable and simple to install. If you have questions about what type is pipe is right  for your home, speak with a plumber for more details. Connect the backup ring, the fiber or rubber gasket and the installing ring to the flange from below the sink. Make sure you snap the backup ring in location. The majority of toilet repairs in the Sugar Land, TX area involve clogged drains, which happen when products get stuck in the pipes. In many cases, this includes bodily waste and can be cleaned up with cautious use of a plunger. When it doesn't, however, you need a certified plumber to make it right.</p>

This procedure is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the whole system.</p>
