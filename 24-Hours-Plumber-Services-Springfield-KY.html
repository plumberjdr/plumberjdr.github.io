<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic system from your house. Then that usually implies that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience blockages in several drains at once in your house. This can take place in several areas and any combination of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your home.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water supply line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it intends straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can actually trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, examine for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
<p>Repiping is carried out by professionals who are specially trained and total most houses in 1-2 days. During a repipe, not every room will be involved in the building.
