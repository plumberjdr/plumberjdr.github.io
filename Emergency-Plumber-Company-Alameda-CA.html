<p>Cured-in place piping is a technique used to repair trenchless relining systems. Professional sewer and drain companies like Roto-Rooter are able to from another location line the area of the pipe that is broken without having to dig a trench.

To resolve the standard clogged drain issue, we will utilize a drain snake to latch onto any blockages and fish them out.

The drains are connected to vertical pipes that are typically linked to underground horizontal pipes connected to local storm sewers. Roto-Rooter can mechanically clean these drains from one end to the other to restore flow and avoid water collection on top of the building's roofing.</p>
