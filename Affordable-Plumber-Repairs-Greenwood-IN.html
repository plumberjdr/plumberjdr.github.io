<p>Back-pressure is the reverse from regular flow direction within a piping system as the result of the downstream pressure being higher than the supply pressure.

Garbage disposal service warranties last an average of 5 years, however they can range in between 2 and ten years. Considering that the typical lifespan of a garbage disposal is 12 years, you may want to purchase a prolonged guarantee.
