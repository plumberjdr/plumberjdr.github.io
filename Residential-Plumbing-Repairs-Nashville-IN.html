<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Because water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly consistent, usage never ever exactly matches supply.
