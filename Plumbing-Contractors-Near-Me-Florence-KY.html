A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800).

Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly.
