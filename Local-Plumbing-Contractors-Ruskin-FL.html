If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety precautions you must take to secure yourself, your household and your home. Some jurisdictions also permit options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply.
