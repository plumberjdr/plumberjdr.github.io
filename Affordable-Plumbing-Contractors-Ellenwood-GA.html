I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial blockage, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
