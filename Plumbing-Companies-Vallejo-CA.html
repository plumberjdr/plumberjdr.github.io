<p>Backflow is bad news. Clamp the drain hose. The water softener requires to drain the diminished salt water solution after the regeneration cycle. Clamp the drain hose firmly and feed it into the dedicated drain, like a floor drain or energy sink. To avoid the hose back siphoning drainage, all drain hose pipes should have an air gap.

<p>To help avoid clogs within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of use the method set out above. Due to the fact that the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste should travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is particularly real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
