<p>Difficult water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water goes through to your house. When the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it should be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is generally utilized in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start again.</p>
