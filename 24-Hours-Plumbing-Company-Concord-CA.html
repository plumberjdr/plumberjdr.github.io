<p>To help avoid blockages within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of use the technique laid out above. Because the baffle successfully halves the interior size of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste needs to travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is specifically real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
