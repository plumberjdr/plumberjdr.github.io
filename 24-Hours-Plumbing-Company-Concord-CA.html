When the waste needs to travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is specifically real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
