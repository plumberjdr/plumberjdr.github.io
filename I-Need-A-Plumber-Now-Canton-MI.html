<p>Re-piping is a process of changing the supply pipes in a home or service.

Corrosion of pipes might trigger low water pressure, rusty colored water, reduced water circulation, or leakages. If you are going to renovate it is a good time to repipe before you paint or finish your walls.  It is very important to comprehend the scope of the job before work is begun. If you notice an isolated leak or a little portion of your existing piping leaking, or valves that are rusted or broken, it is quite potentially an indicator of a larger issue.</p>
