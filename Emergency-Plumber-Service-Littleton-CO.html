We service pipelines throughout the state of Georgia, from Atlanta to Athens, Savannah to Augusta, Macon to Marietta, GA, and beyond. The images provide a sample of a backflow device situated behind the water meter.</p>
<p>An rdc resembles a DC in that it is a mechanical backflow preventer consisting of 2 individually acting, spring-loaded check valves. Nevertheless, it usually does not consist of shutoff valves, may or might not be geared up with test cocks or ports, and is normally less reliable than a DC. An rdc works versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage but ought to be utilized to separate just nonhealth hazards and is intended for use only in water service connections to single-family houses.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain won't fix the problem. You might have to check out utilizing a high pressure water system to remove the clog. This procedure is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the intensity of the clog. At the time of inspection, make sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>
