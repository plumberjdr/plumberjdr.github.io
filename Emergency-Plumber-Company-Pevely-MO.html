<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could take place. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high risk" facilities.</p>
