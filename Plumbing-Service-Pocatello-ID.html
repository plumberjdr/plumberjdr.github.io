<p>Lubrication may assist with the positioning of some elements within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not assist the assembly work any better, it is only there to help the professional assemble the parts into the body without producing damage from friction.

<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage units. Since water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately constant, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly stored for later use when need rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
