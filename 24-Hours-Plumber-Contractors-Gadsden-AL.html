<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
