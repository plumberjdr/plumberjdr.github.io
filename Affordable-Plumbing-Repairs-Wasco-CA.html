<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it challenging to access to in-wall pipes, think about a minimum of changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a big task, changing exposed pipes in a energy, basement, or crawlspace  room is relatively simple, because the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets should absolutely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet must be changed. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural stability of the house.</p>
