<p>If you're fairly inexperienced, a hot water heater installation is not the repair on which to hone your plumbing skills. So save yourself some severe trouble by being truthful with yourself about where your experience level is. Many backflow preventers are designed to enable the elements to be removed for repair while the main body remains set up in the piping system. Getting rid of the backflow preventer to repair it is not essential most of the times. Some elements such as relief valve bodies might need to be removed from the main body to help with a repair. Knowing the proper order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>

Sometimes, a handyman may figure out that a replacement part is required (like a tailpiece, pvc, or reducer  trap) to ensure regular operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman agent today to talk about repair choices.</p>
