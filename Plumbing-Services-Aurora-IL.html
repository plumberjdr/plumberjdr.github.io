Tough water doesn't start hard-- instead, it gets mineral deposits as it is available in contact with limestone underground. These mineral deposits stay when the water is routed into pipes for residential and commercial use, unless the water is softened or filtered.</p>
<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The two indications of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals accumulate in time, they gradually start to restrict the flow of water, leading to low water pressure.

Red or brown water results when littles rust break off from the pipes into your water system, impacting your water quality.</p>
