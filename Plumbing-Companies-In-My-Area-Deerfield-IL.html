<p>Your initial step is to turn off the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, switch off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A versatile supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Photo 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a different design from the one we show, examine the instructions.

This is where the chemicals are introduced to go downstream of the check valve.</p>
<p>When the potable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may happen. Greater pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. Safe and clean and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system if these connections are not correctly protected.
