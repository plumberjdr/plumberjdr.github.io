<p>When it comes to repiping and replacing plumbing in your house, this is one of the main and very first concerns that you need to ask yourself. The age of your home is a critical element to comprehend whether you need to repipe your house. This is not just due to the fact that your plumbing has aged with time, but likewise due to the fact that houses that were constructed before a certain period are more likely to contain galvanized steel, understood to be a metal that is out-of-date in the world of plumbing and beyond due to its level of sensitivity to rust. If your home was built before the 1970s, we highly encourage that you work with a plumbing professional to examine your home's plumbing and inspect if there are locations that need repiping. Opportunities are that your house may need extensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can operate at optimal rates if your house was constructed years before that.</p>
<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to press the ring up a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and remove the mount ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>
