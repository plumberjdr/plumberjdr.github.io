<p>Unless your bathroom restoration is simply cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing may extremely well become part of your task requirements. Water gets in the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has a negative charge, which brings in the favorably charged minerals in the water (a process referred to as, ion exchange). The mineral deposits hold on to the resin and the now-softened water exits the softener tank and streams throughout your home. Tankless technology makes good sense.

<p>Minnesota has a growing issue with chloride in water. Chloride in water threatens our fresh-water fish and other water life. The chloride used in house water softeners can likewise affect the water used for drinking. It takes just one teaspoon of salt chloride salt to permanently pollute five gallons of water. When salt remains in water, there is no easy way to eliminate it.

<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two dead giveaways of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up in time, they slowly begin to restrict the flow of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a long period of time for this much accumulation to occur, so by the time you see it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, impacting your water quality.</p>
