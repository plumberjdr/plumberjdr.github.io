<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system must be continuously kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
