Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone.

<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units. Because water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately consistent, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily stored for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
