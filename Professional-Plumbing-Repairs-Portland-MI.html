<p>Leaks are sneaky. While the time needed will vary based on your house size and the variety of found malfunctions, it's best to reserve approximately 2 hours when you arrange an inspection. There's always the possibility that your plumber's previous job will run long and postpone the starting time. If the plumber finishes in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely rushed the task (unless you have a very small plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection normally takes when you call to arrange your visit.</p>
<p>It is an excellent concept to have your pipes inspected every 5 years to see how they're holding up. When pipes begin to go, it is important to have them changed out right away to prevent leaks and pipe bursts, both of which can do pricey damage to your house. Bear in mind that pipes do not have a "busy season," they see routine use year round. Schedule service today and start keeping a record of their maintenance history if you can't keep in mind the last time you had your pipes looked at.</p>
