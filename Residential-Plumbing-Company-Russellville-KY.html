<h3>An Easy Approach To Find A Reliable Plumber Russellville KY</h3>
<p>Close all outside windows and doors and switch on your bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans. Then open a neighboring warm water faucet until you hear the burner in the water heater spark. After a minute, move a smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Photo 7) on top of the heater. The smoke must be drawn up the vent pipe. If the smoke does not draw, the fumes from the burner aren't venting. Turn off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to fix the issue.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material.

More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
