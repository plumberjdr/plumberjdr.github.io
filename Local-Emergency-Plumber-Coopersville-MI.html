<p>In spite of the Romans' common usage of lead pipes, their aqueducts rarely poisoned people.

<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Coopersville MI</h3>
<p>Just like kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your bathtub, shower, or sink) can be remedied quickly if the obstruction is shallow and basic. For many blockages you'll just need a plunger, and often some chemicals, however if this does not resolve the issue then you may likewise have to contact a drain specialist like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is also harder to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>
