<p>To assist avoid obstructions within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than use the approach set out above. It's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up since the baffle efficiently halves the interior diameter of the tee. This is specifically true when the waste should travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change instructions to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
