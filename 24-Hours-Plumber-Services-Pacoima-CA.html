<p>Identification of liquid, gas and air leakages: Using electronic, thermal and acoustical imaging locating equipment to determine leaks. Whether you need garbage disposal repair or installation, Maeser can assist. A garbage disposal is an important kitchen appliance in a lot of homes today. While the majority of kitchen sink disposers can handle practically any sort of food waste, they are not unbreakable. When a fork, bone or other things jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Worn impellers on older disposals can become inadequate, increasing the risk of drain clogs.</p>
