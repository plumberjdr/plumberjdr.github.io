<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regenerated, the beads end up being filled with salt ions from the water softener salt. As tough water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Tough water triggers gray or white deposits when water is warmed. Water softening can be used to decrease these symptoms.</p>

Customer Private investigator Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get a quote from personal plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement.
