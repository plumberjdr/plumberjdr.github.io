<p>Toilets are one of those plumbing fixtures that we frequently consider granted-- they're lasting, resilient, and quite consistently there for you when you need them. Similarly, toilets use up such a big part of your bathroom that many people are starting to take them into account when upgrading their bathroom design choices. But that does not suggest toilets are best-- in time they will need to be fixed when something fails, and they might even eventually need to be changed.

<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly restored, the beads end up being full of salt ions from the water softener salt. As hard water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. When water is warmed, difficult water causes gray or white deposits. Water softening can be used to minimize these signs.</p>
